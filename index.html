    <h3>Welcome to SCON3KT</h2>
        <p>A platform to find and advertise products and services, grow bussinesses, share hobbies and interests,
            discover clubs, join religious groups and meet like minded students.</p>
        <p>Did you know that the time you spend in University is the last opportunity you'd have to meet a high
            concentration of people with similar interests, goals, life experiences and hobbies? A large group of people
            from various walks of life, all with different stories to tell and ideas to share? In short the largest
            selection/collection of potential lifelong-friends, lovers, business contacts yet most of us will never meet
            these people. No fault of our own, we just don't have the time or the context to create the oppurtunities to
            meet these people.</p>
        <p>SCON4KT aims to make it easier for you to meet like minded people by (sharing what it is that connects them)
            thus makeing it easier for them to interact.</p>

            new things?</p>
